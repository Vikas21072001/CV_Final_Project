QR Code Detection Project:

Project Overview:-
This project is designed to detect QR codes in images using a deep learning model built on the PyTorch framework. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, with MobileNetV2 used as the backbone for feature extraction.

Features:-
QR Code image dataset loading and preprocessing.
Training and evaluation of a MobileNetV2-based deep learning model.
Real-time image loading validation.
Comprehensive performance tracking via loss and accuracy metrics.
